# Its Raining Cubes
  * It's a 3D game where players catch falling cubes with a moving platform (it moves only in X-axis).
  * It's an infinite loop game.
  * If you catch a cube within the gap, you score.
  * If a cube hits the pink area of the platform, your score will reset to 0.
  * What about green area of the platform? </br>
    If a cube hits the green area, and falls into the gap, you score. If it hits the pink area, your score resets to 0.
